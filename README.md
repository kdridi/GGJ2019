In order to package a version please type this command:

```bash
src/scripts/package [version]
```

The version parameter is the name of app's subdirectory

```bash
ls -l src/app
```

For example:

```bash
src/scripts/package v01
```

The script will create a windows and a macos version

```bash
ls -l release
```
